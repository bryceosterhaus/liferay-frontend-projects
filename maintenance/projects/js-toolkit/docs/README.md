# Liferay JS Toolkit (v3.x)

> ðŸ‘€ Liferay JS Toolkit is slowly transitioning from v2 to v3. If you are new to
> Liferay JS Toolkit we recommend reading
> [v2 docs](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/blob/master/maintenance/projects/js-toolkit/docs/README.md)
> in addition to this documentation to get an idea on how the platform works.
>
> For now, we have migrated the old
> [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/blob/master/maintenance/projects/js-toolkit/packages/generator-liferay-js)
> and [build scripts](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/tree/master/maintenance/projects/js-toolkit/packages/liferay-npm-build-support)
> to a single command line tool named
> [@liferay/cli](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/tree/master/projects/js-toolkit/packages/liferay-cli)
> that takes care of everything for you.
>
> However, we are still using
> [liferay-npm-bundler v2](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/tree/master/maintenance/projects/js-toolkit/packages/liferay-npm-bundler)
> under the hood to build and package the projects.
>
> In the future, we will create a new bundler that most probably will be based
> on
> [browser modules](ihttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
> instead of the
> [AMD Loader](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/tree/master/projects/amd-loader).
>
> We will aim at making the switch to the new bundler and module loading
> architecture transparent, making `@liferay/cli` take care of it as much as
> possible so that you can keep using your old projects without much disruption.
