> ðŸ‘€ This tool is deprecated and its use is discouraged.

The `liferay-npm-imports-checker` is a tool to check `imports` sections of
`.npmbundlerrc` files in a multiproject source tree.

This is normally used in builds containing multiple projects where some of them
import packages from others. An example of such a project would be the
[liferay-npm-bundler-2-example](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example),
where
[npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example/tree/master/modules/npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello)
imports packages from
[npm-angular5-provider](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example/tree/master/modules/npm-angular5-provider)
by means of a
[.npmbundlerrc file](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example/blob/master/modules/npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello/.npmbundlerrc).

When having projects like this one, a common problem is to guarantee that the
`imports` in the `.npmbundlerrc` file match the versions in the provider. If
such condition doesn't hold the project will fail in runtime with the loader
saying that it cannot resolve some version.

To avoid such runtime errors, you can leverage the
`liferay-npm-imports-checker` tool to check that for you during build time and,
thus, not deploying failing bundles.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev liferay-npm-imports-checker
```

## Usage

Usually `liferay-npm-imports-checker` will be called in one of your
`package.json` scripts. A good choose would be a `linting`, `test`, or a `ci`
script, but you can define one of your own too, where the tool is run isolated
or in combination with more checking tools.

To do so, you must have something similar to this in your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "ci": "... && liferay-npm-imports-checker"
}
```

Where the `...` refers to any previous step you need to perform like, for
example, running tests or checking source code format.

When the tool is run, it scans all subdirectories for directories that contain
and/or use npm packages and look like a project (those containing a
`build.gradle`, `.npmbundlerrc` or `.npmbuildrc` file, or a `node_modules`
folder).

After that, it checks, among those projects, the ones containing a
`.npmbundlerrc` file with an `imports` section and tests if the semver
constraints in them match the versions exported by the providers.

For instance, in the example project, the tool would check that
[the @angular/core version constraint in npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example/blob/master/modules/npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello/.npmbundlerrc#L10)
matches
[the @angular/core resolved version in npm-angular5-provider](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-bundler-2-example/blob/master/modules/npm-angular5-provider/package.json#L7).
It would also check the rest of the declarations, of course.

To finish with, if any of the checks fail, the tool exits with an error level
greater than 0:

-   It exits with error level 1 if only warnings were emitted
-   It exits with error level 2 if error and/or warnings were emitted

This is so that you can integrate the tool in your CI, for example, and make
the build fail.

## Configuration file

You can create a `.npmimportscheckerrc` file in the directory where you run the
tool to configure some aspects of the checks. The file is in JSON format and
currently supports the following sections:

-   `ignore`: this is a three levels deep object where first level is the checked
    project's name, second is provider's name, and third is imported package's
    name, whose value must be `true` if you want to skip that check.

For example, this file:

```json
{
	"ignore": {
		"npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello": {
			"npm-angular5-provider": {
				"@angular/core": true
			}
		}
	}
}
```

would make the tool ignore the `@angular/core` check of
`npm-angular5-portlet-say-hello` against `npm-angular5-provider`.

To make it easier to build this file, you can leverage the `--write-ignores`
command line option to write an initial version where all failing checks are
configured as ignored. Then, you can fix and remove any ignored check that you
still want to test in the future.

-   `exclude-folders`: this is an array of folder names that will be excluded
    from load when the tool is run. This is useful to make the tool run faster by
    not recursing unneded folders.

For example, if you configure:

```json
{
	"exclude-folders": ["build", "classes"]
}
```

the tool will completely skip (it won't even look inside) folders named `build`
or `classes` when doing the checks. However, note that the `node_modules`
folder is excluded by default and you don't need to add it to the configuration
file.

-   `check-project-versions`: when set to true, it not only matches semver
    constraints in `.npmbundlerrc` against the provider, but also against the
    project's `node_modules` folder to make sure that the constraints in
    `package.json` and `.npmbundlerrc` are compatible. This is interesting if you
    are running tests against the imported packages, for example, so that you run
    the tests with a version compatible with the one being used in runtime.

## Command line arguments

You can pass the following arguments to the tool (from the command line):

-   **--help**: shows help about accepted command line arguments.

-   **--version**: when given, shows the `liferay-npm-imports-checker` version.

-   **--check-project-versions**: same as `check-project-versions: true` in the
    configuration file.

-   **--write-ignores**: when given, the `liferay-npm-imports-checker` tool will
    update the `ignore` section of your `.npmimportscheckerrc` file with those
    projects that failed. This can be used to obtain an initial
    `.npmimportscheckerrc` file than can then be tweaked manually.

-   **--show-projects-load**: when given, the tool will log all projects found
    inside the source tree. This can be useful to fix issues and/or enhance the
    performance of the tool by ignoring spurious detected projects.
