# Troubleshooting

Once you deploy your solution, it may happen that it doesn't show up or fails
to run. In general, there are myriads of causes why your application may be
failing, but the diagnosis algorithm is more or less always the same.

In this document we will be explaining what's the best algorithm to the date to
be able to diagnose a problem. Feel free to contribute any other steps, ideas,
or solutions you may have applied in your case that you think is worth sharing
with the community (you can create an issue and explain the case there, for
example, so that we can add it to this page). Thanks in advance
:slightly_smiling_face:.

Right now, the minimal steps to follow when something fails are:

1. First of all, try cleaning the output folders of your project and rebuilding
   everything again. We use some caching mechanisms to speed up incremental
   builds but they can fail if you update versions, add or remove dependencies,
   and in general, change project configuration.

2. After cleaning the output folder, activate the
   [dump-report](./reference/dot-npmbundlerrc.md#dump-report) option of
   `.npmbundlerrc` and build your project again. Then inspect the generated
   `liferay-npm-bundler-report.html` (in your project directory) file to see if
   any issue is shown.

Once you are sure that a clean build from scratch fails, try the following
steps to diagnose the problem:

1. First, see if the problem
   [is a known bundling limitation](./caveats/bundling.md) or, if you are
   adapting a framework project, an
   [adaption limitation](./caveats/adaptation.md).

2. Mark the `Explain resolutions` checkbox in `Control Panel > Configuration > System Settings > Infrastructure > JavaScript Loader`: this makes the Loader
   dump diagnostic traces to the JavaScript console and/or any error it is
   finding. You may use the log level filters in your browser's console to
   decide what you want to see whether it is just errors or the whole debugging
   info.

3. Turn combo servlet off adding `javascript.fast.load=false` to your
   `portal.properties`: this makes the Loader request each JS module in a
   single HTTP request, so that it is easier to know what's going on.

This should ease debugging your code.
