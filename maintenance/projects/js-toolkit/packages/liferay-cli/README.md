> This tool is deprecated as of Liferay 2024.Q4/7.4 GA129. We recommend using standard JS tooling such as Vite, EsBuild, Webpack wtc. Modern browsers (and Liferay DXP) all support including JavaScript ECMAScript modules directly, so this tool is no longer needed.

# @liferay/cli

This project hosts the Liferay JS Toolkit CLI Tool.

Inspired by other frameworks, like React, Angular, or Vue.js, the Liferay JS
Toolkit provides a CLI tool to invoke all implemented features, like project
generation, build, deployment, etc.

Find its documentation in the
[@liferay/cli manual](../../docs/manuals/liferay-cli.md).
